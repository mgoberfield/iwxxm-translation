# IWXXM Translation Suite
A repository of examples of TAC and IWXXM message pairs that are deemed by the AvXML task team to be equivalent. As a body these examples represent a set of IWXXM and TAC messages that a tool may expect to be able to translate exactly, with the exception of newlines, which may be different.

Messages are provided for each amendment of ICAO Annex 3, as both the TAC and IWXXM contents may change during each amendment.  For every ".tac" file there should be an equivalent ".xml" file with the same name, and vice versa.  

Note that this repository is not yet official and has been set up for testing and evaluation purposes.

# Contributing
Pull requests with additional cases are both welcomed and encouraged.  File names should indicate the unique aspects of the message.  New cases will be reviewed prior to acceptance into the main branch for validity and translation correctness by the WMO task team: TT-AvXML.
