# IWXXM Translation Suite
A repository of examples of IWXXM and TAC message pairs that are deemed to be equivalent. As a body these examples represent
a set of IWXXM and TAC messages that a tool may expected to be able to translate exactly,
other than whitespace and newlines differences.  This repository is provided by the WMO Task Team for Aviation XML (TT-AvXML)
as a convenience for IWXXM developers, but the contents are not reviewed for correctness by TT-AvXML and has no official status in WMO or ICAO.

Messages are provided for each amendment of ICAO Annex 3, as both the TAC and IWXXM contents may change during each
amendment.  Every XML file should contain an equivalent TAC text as the first line (other than the XML header) in a comment by itself.

# Contributing
Pull requests with additional cases are both welcomed and encouraged.  File names should indicate the unique aspects
of the message and should contain the relevant TAC in a comment.
