All METAR/SPECI IWXXM examples listed here have their root attribute "translatedBulletinID"
set to "S[A|P]XX99XXXX260000". This is artifact of this set of observations used. In operational
practice, and if a IWXXM METAR document was generated from the traditional alphanumeric code
form of the METAR, "translatedBulletinID" should be set to the actual WMO AHL values.
